<!-- 1. Our team never really worked with displaying, playing and storing audio files on a website and we found it hard tog et started. We just ChatGPT to create the basic structure of our website so we had an example to go of on. We did not use the generated code, but did use it to help get us started; it was just as inspiration and for direction. -->

<!-- 3. Our team didn't know how to define and manage multiple audio files in JavaScript.

<!-- 4. We did not know how to manage locked and unlocked sounds with JavaScript on our website. We also did not know how to add buttons that would be visible or not visible based on the availability of the sounds. We asked ChatGPT for a general idea of how to do this. The example gave us a good idea of how to structure the logic. We adapted these ideas into our own code to suit our own needs. We only used the AI for guidance. -->
