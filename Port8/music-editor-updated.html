<h2>What is Happing?</h2>
<p>
You and your team are a group of audio engineers and musicians working on the final
mix of a famous artist's new album. However, the producer mysteriously vanished before
completing the last track, and the studio has gone into lockdown mode due to a system
security breach. The only way out? Finish the mix, unlock the studio, and escape before time
runs out!
</p>
<h2>How to Edit music</h2>
<p>
How can you Edit music to Create a Great SonG? Here we will tell you! First you have to
find A Great SAMPLE. This is Not Hard; just listen to your FAvorITE songs! After that you
need to Get IN THE recording STUDIO. Get togETHER wiTH SoMe FRieNDs and make it a
fun gateway! Just HAvE FuN.
</p>
<h2>Morse Code</h2>
<p>
A → . B → -... C → -.-. D → -.. E → . F → ..-. G → --. H → .... I → .. J → .--- K → -.- L →
.-.. M → -- N → -. O → --- P → .--. Q → --.- R → .-. S → ... T → - U → ..- V → ...-
W → .-- X → -..- Y → -.-- Z → --..
0 → ----- 1 → .---- 2 → ..--- 3 → ...-- 4 → ....- 5 → ..... 6 → -.... 7 → --... 8 → ---.. 9 → ----.
</p>
<h2>How to Release your song</h2>
<p>
You have many different platforms to release your music on. You have things like Spotify
and SoundCloud, but you could even give out physical copies of your music to your friends
and family; this is way more memorable. Another good way is to try to create a TikTok trend
out of it; this will give your song a lot of attention.

<!-- Explanation AI Sourcing -->
<!-- Nothing was directly copied from an AI tool; they were only used to answer questions
and provide basic bare bone structures.-->
<!-- 1. Our team had limited experience with coding a website in HTML and JavaScript and
we found it hard to get started. We just ChatGPT to create the basic structure of our website
so we had an example to go of on. We did not use the generated code, but did use it to help
get us started; it was just as inspiration and for direction. -->
<!-- 2. Our first idea for creating a certain frequency that is dependend on the value of the
slider. This first idea was having a audio file and playing a certain part of that file for a certain
value of the slider. We did not know of any other way to do this, but it was extremly important
for our project, so we asked Chatgpt to look if it was even possible for our coding level to do.
It gave us a method that was eassy to understand and code. We did not use the code
generated by Chatgpt, but did use the method it suggested. -->
<!-- 3. We had some trouble understanding how to connect the website to oocsi and asked
Chatgpt to expalin it to us. We again did not use the generated code, it was only for direction
